# recipe-mongodb-restapi
This repository contains the source code for a RESTful API built with Spring Boot and MongoDB, designed to manage recipes. The API supports all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on recipes, as well as basic search functionality.

The API is built on top of the Spring Boot framework, which provides a robust and scalable foundation for building enterprise-grade applications. MongoDB is used as the underlying database, providing a flexible and scalable solution for storing and retrieving recipe data.

The code is organized into logical layers, with separate modules for data access, business logic, and API controllers. Swagger is used for API documentation, and the API is secured using Spring Security with JWT authentication.

This project serves as an example of how to build a modern, scalable RESTful API using Spring Boot and MongoDB. Feel free to use this as a starting point for your own projects, or as a reference for best practices in API design.
